# Management and Engineering of Cloud Data Infrastructure - Final Project

**Final Project (M.Sc. Data Science, HIT). HR Analytics using PySpark & Scikit-learn: Implementing Random Forest (Supervised) and K-Means (Unsupervised) models for workforce optimization and predictive performance analysis on distributed cloud architecture.**

## Overview
This project analyzes a large-scale HR dataset to demonstrate big data engineering principles such as distributed computing, in-memory processing, and scalable machine learning within a cloud-based architecture.

## Key Features
- **Scalable ETL:** Distributed data cleaning and transformation using PySpark.
- **Advanced Analytics:** - **Supervised Learning:** Implementation of **Random Forest** for performance classification.
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Implementation of **K-Means** for employee clustering and pattern recognition.
- **Decision Support:** Data-driven insights for workforce optimization, promotions, and retention.

## Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Apache Spark (PySpark)
- **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Spark MLlib
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
